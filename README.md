Positioning

Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave differently; for example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. This article explains the different position values, and how to use them.

We'd like you to follow along with the exercises on your local computer, if possible â€” grab a copy of 0_basic-flow.html from our GitHub repo (source code here) and use that as a starting point.
